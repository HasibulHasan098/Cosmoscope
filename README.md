## üèÜ NASA Space Apps Challenge

This project was developed for the [NASA Space Apps Challenge](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/), an international hackathon where teams engage with NASA's open data to address real-world problems on Earth and in space.

### Challenge Statement

Our project addresses the "Create Your Own Challenge" category for the NASA Space Apps Challenge. We identified a problem: space data is often inaccessible and difficult to understand for the general public. Our solution is Cosmoscope - an interactive platform that makes space exploration accessible and engaging for everyone, from space enthusiasts to educators and students.

### AI Capabilities

The Gemini-powered AI assistant in Cosmoscope offers several innovative features:

1. **Interactive Map Exploration**: The AI can analyze map data in real-time, helping users identify and learn about geographical features on Earth and geological formations on Mars.

2. **Image Analysis**: When viewing NASA imagery, the AI can identify objects, explain scientific phenomena, and provide educational context about what users are seeing.

3. **Personalized Space Tours**: Users can ask the AI to create custom "tours" of specific regions on Mars or Earth based on their interests (geology, history of exploration, potential for future missions, etc.).

4. **Scientific Q&A**: The AI serves as a knowledgeable companion, answering questions about space science, astronomy, and NASA missions in an accessible way.

## üì± How to Use the App

### Navigation
- Use the navigation menu at the top to switch between Earth, Mars, and About pages
- Toggle between dark and light mode using the theme switch in the header

### Earth Exploration
1. Navigate to the Earth page
2. Use the interactive map to explore Earth's geography
3. Click on any location to get information about that area
4. Use the search bar to find specific locations
5. Interact with the AI assistant by clicking the chat icon to ask questions about what you're seeing

### Mars Exploration
1. Navigate to the Mars page
2. Browse through NASA's rover imagery of the Martian landscape
3. Click on images to view them in full size
4. Use the filters to find specific types of Mars imagery
5. Ask the AI assistant questions about Martian geology, rover missions, or any features you observe

### AI Chat Assistant
1. Click on the chat icon in the bottom right corner of any page
2. Type your question in the input field
3. The Gemini-powered AI will respond with information about space, NASA missions, or what you're currently viewing
4. You can ask follow-up questions to dive deeper into topics
5. Example questions:
   - "What are those dark spots on Mars?"
   - "Tell me about NASA's Curiosity rover"
   - "What geological features am I looking at in this region?"
   - "Create a tour of interesting craters on Mars"

### Image Gallery
1. Navigate to either Earth or Mars pages
2. Browse through the image collections
3. Click on any image to open it in full-screen mode
4. Use the navigation arrows to move between images
5. Click outside the image or the X button to close the full-screen view

### Tips for Best Experience
- For optimal performance, use a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- Enable location services if you want to see your current position on Earth maps
- Try different search terms when exploring maps to discover interesting locations
- Combine the AI chat with map exploration for a more educational experience
